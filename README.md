# Mini-project
This project implements a new image encryption system combining hill cipher with elliptic curve cryptosystem

 Create a virtual environment 
 Install the following packages within the virtual environment
  i)pip
  ii)numpy
  iii)matplot lib
  iv)scikit image 
 import these packages where and when necessary 
 Run Encryption.py 
 Run Decryption.py
 Enter the public key from decryption process as input for encryption process
 Enter the public key of encryption process as input for Decryption process
 Outputs will be displayed.
